# UML and Class Diagrams

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized visual modeling language used in the field of software engineering to provide a general-purpose, developmental, and intuitive way to visualize the design of a system. UML helps in specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems.

### Need for UML
- Complex applications need collaboration and planning from multiple teams and hence require a clear and concise way to communicate amongst them.
- Businessmen do not understand code. So UML becomes essential to communicate with non-programmers about essential requirements, functionalities, and processes of the system.
- A lot of time is saved down the line when teams can visualize processes, user interactions, and the static structure of the system.

## Class Diagram
The most widely use UML diagram is the class diagram. It is the building block of all object oriented software systems. We use class diagrams to depict the static structure of a system by showing systemâ€™s classes, their methods and attributes. Class diagrams also help us identify relationship between different classes or objects.

In these diagrams, classes are depicted as boxes, each containing three compartments for the class name, attributes, and methods. Lines connecting classes illustrate associations, showing relationships such as one-to-one or one-to-many.

### Class
In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes, and each class defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (functions or procedures) that the objects created from that class will possess. 

The attributes represent the characteristics or properties of the object, while the methods define the behaviors or actions that the object can perform.
